This repo contains scripts to download random wikipedia articles, and to extract
a text corpus from them, suitable for analyzing the language they were written
in.

Wikipedia articles were chosen, since:

- There is a “Random article” feature.
- There are articles on almost every topic, which should result in varied
  language.
- The articles are written by lots of different people in contemporary English.
- They’re easy and legal to get.

Under [releases] you can find a 13MB English text corpus made from 5000
wikipedia articles available for download!
